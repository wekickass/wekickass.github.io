Hi! This is the main repo for the Kickass Partners website!

### Want to contribute? Add a new section?
This is pretty much an static HTML + CSS website, except by the fact that I wanted to be smart and decided on using postcss to be able to use loops inside my css for the grid.

#### Instalation

1. Make sure you have Node and NPM
2. `npm i --only=dev`

#### Making CSS changes
1. Change the `.pcss` file
2. Run `npm run css` on your terminal to run the scripts
3. YAY!

#### TODO:
1. Proper media queries because now they're so poorly done, it has a ton of !importants and that is bad.
