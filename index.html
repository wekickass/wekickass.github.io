      <p class="col-lg-start-2 col-lg-end-9">
        We are essentially a boutique agency and operate strictly on a retainer basis, very similar to the way you would hire a high-caliber law firm. The first step is to hiring us is to set up a phone call or video conference with our founder Obie Fernandez in order to discuss your needs and explore whether we’d make a good fit for your particular situation. If you already have some technology in place for your product, we may decide to start off with an audit, which generally costs around a thousand dollars. After that we would figure out initial estimates, figure out a schedule that works for your need, and contract the relationship using a retained services agreement. We keep formal project management activities to a minimum, relying on tools like Zenhub and Github Issues to do Kanban-style organization of work. Depending on the scope of your retainer, you can expect to be in communication with our staff anywhere from a couple times a week to a continual basis, mostly via Slack.
